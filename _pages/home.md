### About me

Hello! My name is Yukai Wang (王于凯). I was born in Shandong, China, and I am currently a PhD student at The Cho Chun Shik Graduate School of Mobility, KAIST, under the supervision of [Prof. Tiantian Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/chentiantian/home). 
In 2020, I completed my undergraduate studies at Southwest Jiaotong University, where I was recognized as the Honorable Student of [Mao Yisheng Honors College](https://mys.swjtu.edu.cn/en/About/Profile_of_Mao_Yisheng.htm). 

I then pursued master at Southeast University between 2020 and 2023, advised by [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=RVL8KNIAAAAJ).
### Welcome!

My research spans a broad spectrum of topics, including traffic safety, simulation techniques, and various learning methods such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and reinforcement learning (RL). Recently, I have been actively involved in research on autonomous driving, world models, reinforcement learning, and safety analysis. I am always open to collaboration opportunities.
